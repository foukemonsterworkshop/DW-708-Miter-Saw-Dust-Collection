# Miter-Saw-Dust-Collection
The last iteration of my DW-708 dust collection before upending my workflow and switching to linux :)

I'm not certain what state this CAD file was left in, and I'm sure it's bad.

## Project Description
The final iteration utilized a variety of magnets for quick assembly/disassembly, and aluminum duct tape as a semi-flexible air flow guide.

All of the obj, stl, or 3d file formats combine the multi-part assembly into a singullar, unprintable shape.
So I hope you ilke Fusion....
